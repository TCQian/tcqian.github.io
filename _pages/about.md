Hello! I’m **Tan Chia Qian**, a first‑year Computer Science PhD student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Vision**, where I explore novel methods for robust perception and learning.

I completed my Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) in 2023 at NUS. Now, I’m diving into deep learning methods for visual understanding, adversarial robustness, and multimodal inference.

On this site you’ll find:

- **Publications & Preprints**  
  A curated list of my conference and journal papers, along with links to preprints and code.

- **Teaching & Mentoring**  
  Coursework I’ve taught, tutorials I’ve developed, and mentees I’ve supervised.

- **Portfolio & Projects**  
  Demos, code and datasets from research prototypes and side‐projects.

- **Blog**  
  Occasional posts on AI/vision research insights, implementation tips, and conference trip reports.

# A data-driven personal website

This site uses the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), built on GitHub Pages. All my content—publications, talks, teaching materials—is stored as structured Markdown and YAML files in this repository. Whenever I push updates, GitHub automatically rebuilds and deploys the site.

# Getting started with your own site

1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) on GitHub.
2. Rename the repo to `<your‑username>.github.io`.
3. Edit `_config.yml` to set your name, affiliation, and repository URL.
4. Add or modify content in the `_publications`, `_talks`, `_teaching`, and `_posts` folders.
5. Upload any supplementary files (PDFs, datasets) to the `files/` directory.
6. Commit & push—your site will be live at `https://<your‑username>.github.io`.

Feel free to explore the [Minimal Mistakes theme docs](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/) and the [Academic Pages guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/) for further customization. If you have questions, open a discussion on the Academic Pages GitHub repo!
